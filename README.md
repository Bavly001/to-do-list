# To do list :memo:
  
The main idea for the project is to make a to-do list which totally depends on using browser local storage.
  
  
The challenge that faced was that is the first time to use local storage to store data so I go deep into it. 
  
  
The stored data:
- Uncompleted tasks
- Completed tasks
- Theme mode
